INTRODUCTION

This document explains the installation and use of EP.EXE ver
1.0, an Autodesk Device Interface (ADI) driver designed to run
with Epson 24 pin printers in conjunction with AutoCAD and
AutoSketch.  This driver was developed by Autodesk, Inc.  and
does not represent an endorsement of any particular product,
including any of the Epson printers.
     
Autodesk, Inc.  makes no warranty, either expressed or implied,
including but not limited to any implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, regarding
these materials and makes such materials available on an "as-is"
basis.


HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The hardware requirements specific to using the EP printer ADI
driver with AutoCAD and AutoSketch.

   o This driver is suitable for use with all 24 pin Epson
     printers in the "LQ" series, but some printers can't use all
     of the options provided by the driver.  For example, a
     narrow carriage printer can't handle wide plots and some
     models can't print in color.  Please refer to your Epson
     user's manual for details.

   o A parallel card and cable is required as described in the
     AutoCAD Installation & Performance Guide.

   o Serial output is not supported because the time required to
     plot would be unacceptably long.


HARDWARE INSTALLATION

The Epson printer must be connected to the computer with a
standard Centronics-type parallel cable.  Chapter 8 of the
AutoCAD Installation & Performance Guide contains all the
information regarding pin connections and switch settings.


COPYING THE DRIVER SOFTWARE

The Epson printer ADI driver for AutoCAD and AutoSketch comes on the
ADI Drivers update diskette.  The disk also contains a file EP.HLP for
on-line command line options.  You will probably want to install the
driver in the same directory as AutoCAD.  Here's how to copy the driver
software onto your hard disk.  The example assumes an AutoCAD directory
is on drive C and is named \ACAD and the ADI driver update disk is in
drive A:

1. Change to the directory where you store AutoCAD:

    C:> CD ACAD [Return]

2.  Insert the ADI driver update diskette in drive A.

3. Copy the driver files to your hard disk:

    C:> COPY A:\EP\EP*.*  [Return]


INSTALLING THE ADI EP DRIVER

The AutoCAD Epson printer ADI driver must be installed (loaded
into memory) prior to entering AutoCAD.  It is a "terminate and
stay resident" (TSR) software program which can use up to 77K of
RAM depending on how it is configured.  Once loaded, it remains
in memory until you turn off or reboot your computer. 

** Note: Each time you type in the command EP (except for the
special case of the "F" option for plotting binary files),
another copy of the driver software is loaded into memory, using
up to 77k more bytes of RAM.  You need to "reboot" the system (to
clear out the any copies of EP.EXE).


To install the driver:

    C:> EP [Return]

The Epson ADI driver will then be installed with the following
defaults:

    o  Interrupt 7b(hex)
    o  Monochrome
    o  180 x 180 Dots per inch print density
    o  8" Paper width
    o  AutoSketch is off
    o  Output directly to printer
    o  Input from AutoCAD
    o  form feed after every plot


To change this setup, you can choose to include one or more
options on the command line.  These options are:

-lx parallel port x
-f plot from a file     -v interrupt #      -c color      -p no form feed
-o plot to a file       -w wide paper       -8 8 pins     -dx density x                         



To install the driver to do color printer plots (if your Epson is
color capable and you have the color ribbon installed):

    C:> EP -C  [Return]
        (default is monochrome)

To set the horizontal plot density

    C:> EP -Dx [Return]  (where x is 1 to 6 in the following table):
        (default is 180 x 180)

                        x     Horizontal   Vertical
                                Density    Density
                        1         60         180
                        2         90         180
                        3         120        180
                        4         180        180
                        5*        360        180
                        6**       360        360

*Note: Option -D5, when combined with the color option, -C, is limited
to plots less than 11.3 inches in width, when plotting from AutoCAD 386.

**Note: Option -D6 is not available as a installed TSR in color
mode.

You can also install the driver to write plot files directly to
your disk drive for later printing (this will create a file named
'fname' on your default drive for later printing).  This is
useful for printing multiple copies of a plot.  See the section
titled "OUTPUTTING EPSON PRINTER FILES FOR DIRECT PRINTING FROM
DISK" for more details:

    C:> EP -Ofname [Return]


You can use the driver to read AutoCAD Binary printer plot files
directly from your disk drive.  This allows you to use plotting
modes which would use too much memory for plotting from AutoCAD
as a TSR.  This option does not install the driver as a TSR, and
may be used repeatedly.  See the section titled "USE AS A
POSTPROCESSOR" for more details:

    C:> EP -Ffname [Return]

Note:  These filenames must conform to DOS standards.

To install the driver for printing on wide paper (will create a
plot up to 13.6" wide):

    C:> EP -W [Return]
        (default is 8")


To install the driver to only use 8 pins of the print head (will
require much less the RAM for the TSR, but will print more
slowly):

    C:> EP -8 [Return]
        (default is the 24 pins)



To install the driver to use a different parallel port:

    C:> EP -Lx [Return] (where x is the new port assignment 1, 2 or 3)
        (default is LPT1)


To install the driver to work with AutoSketch (if you use
AutoSketch and don't use this option, messages will be written on
the screen over your drawing):

    C:> EP -S [Return]
        (default writes messages to the screen)


To install the driver to not send a form feed after each plot:

    C:> EP -P [Return]
        (default is a form feed after every plot) 


To install the driver for a different interrupt vector (default
is 7B hex):

    C:> EP -Vxx [Return]  (where xx is the new interrupt number)


To display a list of these options:

    C:> EP -H or -? [Return]  Prints a help message from ep.hlp


To install the driver using a combination of the above options:


    C:> EP -Oplotdata.plt -c -v7b -8   This will do the following:

         1.  Create a plot file 'plotdata.plt' of your drawing on your
             default drive for plotting at a later time.
         2.  Make a color print of the plot.
         3.  The interrupt vector will be 78 (in hex).
         4.  Will only use 8 pins.

** Note: There are only 2 densities in the vertical direction.
If you do not have both AutoCAD and this driver configured for the
same dots per inch, your drawing may be expanded or compressed in
the y-axis.

CONFIGURING AUTOCAD FOR THE EPSON 24 PIN PRINTER DRIVER It is
necessary to reconfigure AutoCAD for an installed ADI printer
plotter driver.  You will only need to do this before you want to
use the EP ADI driver for the first time, or when you change the
paper width or the horizontal or the vertical plot densities of
your Epson ADI.  Note the present configuration of EP.EXE when
you install it.  AutoCAD's printer plotter configuration
densities must be equal for your plots to be correct.
Reconfigure AutoCAD for an installed printer plotter ADI driver <2>.
Be sure that you:

    1.  Select output format as an Installed ADI driver <2>.

    2.  Set the maximum horizontal (X) plot size in inches.
        These values are 7.99" for the standard size or 13.59"
        for the wide carriage printers.  The vertical (Y) axis
        should be set to your paper size, 10.5 is a good value.

    3.  Set the density equal to the installed density of the
        driver EP.EXE.  If AutoCAD's density (dots/inch) is
        greater, your drawing will be expanded along that axis
        and may be clipped.  If the drivers density is greater,
        your drawing will be compressed along that axis.
        
    4.  The vertical or y-axis has only 2 densities, 180
        dots/inch and 360 dpi.  For most printer plotting, 180
        dpi should be fine.

See the Chapter 8, the printer configuration section of the
Installation & Performance Guide to AutoCAD, Chapter 13 of your
main Reference Manual for AutoCAD details, and your EP Users
guide for printer details.

AutoCAD will now be configured to do a printer plot using the
installed EP ADI driver.



CREATING PRINTER PLOTS WITH THE EPSON 24 PIN PRINTER DRIVER


To send plots to the Epson printer from AutoCAD's drawing editor
select Plot then Printer from the AutoCAD menu or type 'prplot'
at the command line.  From AutoCAD's Main Menu select Printer
Plot <4>.  Make sure your printer is connected, turned on and on
line and hit return when ready.  Your plot will be produced on
your Epson 24 pin printer.

** Note: printer plots take a long time to produce, so don't worry if
nothing happens for a while.  They can take a very long time depending
on the complexity of the drawing, if you chose color or if the plot
density is high.


OUTPUTTING EPSON PRINTER FILES FOR DIRECT PRINTING FROM DISK


You may wish to create a file that may be printed multiple times
directly from disk.  You can do this with the DOS copy command
without running AutoCAD or EP driver after the file is created.

CAUTION: This option should be used with care.  It is possible to
create a file larger than 8 Megabytes if all the settings are at
their maximum.  If it is used with some thought it will produce
good results.

Here is an example:

Say you want to produce a 360 x 180 dpi color plot of the
site-3d.dwg on 13.59" wide paper.

Install the EP ADI printer driver by typing:

    C:> EP -d5 -Osite-3d.epo -C -W [Return]


Configure AutoCAD as a ADI printer at 360 x 180 dpi, and a
horizontal width of 13.59".  Run AutoCAD and printer plot the
site-3d.dwg file.  The file site-3d.epo will be created on the
default disk for later printing from the command line.

Note that the combination of -W, -C and -d5 won't allow you to plot
beyond 11.3" width with AutoCAD 386, so you'll need to lower the
plot width if you use AutoCAD 386.

AutoCAD 386 places a limitation on real mode ADI printer plotter
drivers such as this one. A maximum of 4096 color pixels can
be printed in the X direction. If you configure this driver
for TSR operation, color, density 5 (180x360dpi) and wide
paper, you must limit the width of the plot to less than 11.3".
This limitation is not necessary with 640k DOS AutoCAD.


You can print the file from the DOS command line by typing:

    C:> COPY SITE-3D.EPS PRN /B [Return]

In the above example, if you plotted the <E>xtents it would
create a file of 3 Megabytes and would take over an hour to be
produced on a IBM system 30.  But if you created a file of the
<D>isplay at 180 x 180 dpi for 7.99" wide paper by typing the
following:

        
     C:> EP -C -Osite-3d.epo    

the file site-3d.epo would be only .3 Megabytes.  The creation
time for this file is only 5 minutes on an AT clone running at 10
Mhz.


USE AS A POSTPROCESSOR

The ADI driver EP.EXE can work as a postprocessor, reading
AutoCAD ADI binary files from your disk and sending them directly
to the printer.  Printer plot to an ADI binary printer file from
AutoCAD or AutoSketch 2.0.  Then, when the Autodesk product is no
longer running, you may use EP.EXE to plot from the binary file
to your Epson printer.

Here's an example:

You want to produce a 360x360 dpi color plot of site-3d.dwg on
13.59" wide paper.  First you run AutoCAD's configuration program
to select the ADI Printer, plot to binary file, 360x360 dots per
inch, and 13.6" horizontal paper width.  Use the PRPLOT command
in AutoCAD.  This produces a binary printer plot file called
"site-3d.prp".  Next, exit AutoCAD and plot the drawing by
invoking:

    EP -Fsite-3d.prp -C -D6 -W

This will cause EP.EXE to make a plot of the contents of the file
"site-3d.prp" in color at 360 x 360 dpi on wide paper.  When the
plot is done, EP.EXE will vanish from memory (it does not install
itself as it would if you wanted to plot directly from AutoCAD).

**Note: If you added -Osite-3d.epo to the above command line,
the data wouldn't be sent to the printer but a file named
site-3d.epo would be created.  See the above section titled
"OUTPUTTING EPSON PRINTER FILES FOR DIRECT PRINTING FROM DISK"
for details.

AutoSketch 2.0 or later supports this feature.  Earlier versions did not
create binary plot files.


USE WITH AUTOSKETCH

The ADI EP driver may be used with AutoSketch.  Just remember to
use the -S flag on the control line.  Failure to do this will
cause driver messages to printed on the AutoSketch screen,
overwriting the drawing displayed there.

The EP.EXE drivers dated after 2/4/90 work with 8088 class machines.
Previously it would hang the computer.

Before you install this driver for AutoSketch, make sure that
your Epson printer is turned on and on-line.  If it is not the
driver will not be installed and an error message will appear
telling you that it wasn't installed.

Before every plot from AutoSketch using this ADI driver, you must
make sure that the printer is turned on, connected and on line.
Failure to do this will return you to the drawing screen with out
any error messages.  If the printer goes off-line, runs out of
paper or becomes disconnected at any time during the plot, no
more data will be sent to the printer and you will be returned to
the drawing screen again without any error messages.  Therefore
if your drawing is not being plotted at all or stops plotting and
you are returned to the drawing editor, make sure the printer has
paper, is turned on, connected and on line.

AutoSketch must be reconfigured so that it knows you will be
using an ADI driver to do printer plots.  To initiate
AutoSketch's reconfiguration, type:

     C:>SKETCH /R [Return]

or if you're installing AutoSketch for the first time, type:

     C:>SKETCH [Return]

Configure AutoSketch's plotter as an Autodesk Device Interface
Printer <3>.  AutoSketch will prompt you for more information
regarding this ADI driver.  See the section titled 'CONFIGURING
AUTOCAD FOR THE EPSON 24 PIN PRINTER DRIVER' and Appendix B: the
ADI Plotter section in the AutoSketch Users Guide.

AutoSketch prompts you to indicate how your plotter is connected
to your computer, choose:

     2.  Parallel port, system printer, or hardware handshake
         serial port

Then follow the instructions in Configuring AutoSketch in Chapter
2 of the AutoSketch Users Guide.  Remember this ADI driver can
only be used as a parallel device.

**Note: When you open the plot area dialogue box, the values for
x and y may be incorrect.  Set them now, to the size of the paper
you have in your printer.  Rotating the plot may also work.



NOTES ON OPERATION:  AutoCAD TIPS AND HINTS for the EP ADI Driver

1.  If you will use the EP ADI driver with every session of
    AutoCAD, you may want to place the EP.EXE command in your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file with the correct options set, because you
    must install the Printer driver after every reset of your
    system. 

2.  The Printer must be connected, turned on, and on line before
    you plot a file using the EP ADI driver.

3.  Do not turn the Printer on and off in the middle of a
    plotting session.  An error message will be displayed if you
    try to use the ADI EP driver while the Printer is turned off.

4.  If you're using the tractor feed, make sure you've advanced
    the paper far enough for the paper bail contact the platen.

5.  Only Colors numbered 1 through 7 are printed, colors 8 to 15
    are converted to black (#7), so, don't use colors numbered
    greater than seven.  

6.  If you are using this ADI driver with AutoSketch in a color
    mode make sure that you configure EACH AutoSketch drawing's
    Pen Info for the different colors.  If you don't it will
    default to red and your entire drawing will be in red.

7.  You will find that high density and/or color plots take much
    longer to complete than low density and/or monochrome plots.

8.  The 360x360 dot per inch density can be used with all LQ2550
    and LQ950 models.  Recent LQ850 and LQ1050 printers can also
    handle this high density mode.  Older LQ850 and LQ1050
    printers will need a firmware (ROM) upgrade to handle 360x360
    dpi.  You can tell if your printer can plot 360x360 dpi by
    running self-test and checking the ROM revision number.  You
    need a number starting with N9.

9.  Note that the different density options use different amounts
    of memory in your computer.  High density plots need a lot of
    memory.  They also take a long time to complete!  Color adds
    greatly to the memory and time requirements.  Memory used up
    by drivers is subtracted from the memory your drawings need
    when you run AutoSketch.  AutoCAD doesn't have that problem,
    but there still is limited memory available for use by
    drivers.  The highest density color modes use so much memory
    that it isn't possible to plot directly from AutoCAD (much
    less AutoSketch), so this driver offers an optional file
    input mode.
